# CO2-Classroom-Node

## Installation
To install the Operating System to you ESP32, go to the [/micropy]("micropy") folder and run the install script. Based on your operating system, you have to choose .bat or .sh. At the moment we do not support the Mac OS.

Afterwards install [https://thonny.org](Thonny) and select ESP32 as interpreter. Connect your ESP32 again and upload the scripts from [/Code](the code folder). If you want to use the full version with RaspberryPi Docker support and a web interface, you have to edit the mywlan.py file and insert your internet details.
